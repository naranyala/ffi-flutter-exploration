4 AM with some friends
Driving to the most
Beautiful place ever
Oh, beer and bread and chips
And cigarettes
Unlike the day before

I want you stay
Stay right there in my head
Take no step even miles
Or I'll go along

Jumping as two circles or four
Hoping you don't mind dear
Singing through the inches of waves
Unlike the day before

It's raining
We still go anyway
Just to get the corner of your eyes
Eyes...
Eyes...
Eyes...

I want you stay
Stay right there in my head
Take no step even miles
Or I'll go along

I want you stay
Stay right there in my head
Take no step even miles
Or I'll go along
